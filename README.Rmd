# GoFluxYourself: A user-friendly way to calculate GHG fluxes yourself, regardless of user experience<img src="man/figures/GoFluxYourself.png" align="right" width="200"/>

### One Package to rule them all

Non-steady state chambers are widely used for measuring soil greenhouse gas
(GHG) fluxes, such as CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, and water vapor (H~2~O). While linear
regression (LM) is commonly used to estimate GHG fluxes, this method tends to
underestimate the pre-deployment flux (*f*~0~). Indeed, a non-linearity is
expected when gas concentration increases inside a closed chamber, due to
changes in diffusion gradients between the soil and the air inside the chamber.
In addition, lateral gas flow and leakage contribute to non-linearity. Many
alternative to LM have been developed to try and provide a more accurate
estimation of *f*~0~, for instance the method of [Hutchinson and Mosier (HM)
(1981)](https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500020017x), which was
implemented in the [`HMR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HMR) package by
[Pedersen et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2010.01291.x).
However, non-linear models have a tendency to largely overestimate some flux
measurements, due to an exaggerated curvature. Therefore, the user is expected
to decide which method is more appropriate for each flux estimate. With the
advent of portable greenhouse gas analyzers (e.g. [Los Gatos Research (ABB)
laser gas
analyzers](https://new.abb.com/products/measurement-products/analytical/laser-gas-analyzers/laser-analyzers/lgr-icos-portable-analyzers)),
soil GHG fluxes have become much easier to measure, and more efficient ways to
calculate these flux estimates are needed in order to process large amounts of
data. A recent approach was developed by [H端ppi et al.,
2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200876) to restrict the curvature in
the HM model for a more reliable flux estimate. In the HM model, the curvature
is controlled by the kappa parameter. H端ppi et al. suggested the use of the
kappa.max to limit the maximal curvature allowed in the model (see their R
package [`gasfluxes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gasfluxes), available
on the CRAN). This procedure introduces less arbitrary decisions in the flux
estimation process.

Previous software that have been developed to calculate GHG fluxes were limited
in many aspects that this package is meant to overcome. Most were limited to the
linear regression approach (e.g. [LI-COR
SoilFluxPro](https://www.licor.com/env/products/soil-flux/soilfluxpro), [Flux
Puppy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192319301522), and
the R packages [`flux`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flux) and
[`FluxCalR`](https://github.com/junbinzhao/FluxCalR)), others were compatible
with only one designated system (e.g. [LI-COR
SoilFluxPro](https://www.licor.com/env/products/soil-flux/soilfluxpro), [Flux
Puppy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192319301522)),
and some were impractical with large amounts of measurements (e.g. the R package
[`HMR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HMR)) or simply did not include data
pre-processing (e.g. the R packages
[`HMR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HMR),
[`flux`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flux) and
[`gasfluxes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gasfluxes)).

This new R package, `GoFluxYourself` is meant to be "student proof", meaning
that no extensive knowledge or experience is needed to import raw data into R,
chose the best model to calculate fluxes (LM, HM or no flux), quality check the
results objectively and obtain high quality flux estimates. The package contains
a wide range of functions that allows the user to import raw data from a variety
of instruments (LI-COR, LGR, GAIA2TECH and Picarro); calculate fluxes from a
variety of GHG (CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, and H~2~O) with both linear (LM) and
non-linear (HM) flux calculation methods; align instruments clocks after data
import; interactively identify measurements (start and end time) if there are no
automatic chamber recordings (e.g. LI-COR smart chamber); plot measurements for
easy visual inspection; and quality check the measurements based on objective
criteria and non-arbitrary thresholds.

### About the package

This package `GoFluxYourself` is meant to be "student proof", meaning that no
extensive knowledge or experience is needed to import raw data into R (except
for knowing how to use R, of course), chose the best model to calculate fluxes
(LM or HM, that is the question. -Shakespeare, 1603), quality check the results
objectively (hence the no experience needed) and obtain high quality flux
estimates from static chamber measurements (wonderful!).

The package contains a wide range of functions that lets the user import raw
data from a variety of instruments:

-   [**LI-COR trace gas
    analyzers**](https://www.licor.com/env/products/trace-gas/): LI-7810 for
    CO~2~, CH~4~ and H~2~O, LI-7820 for N~2~O and H~2~O
-   [**LI-COR Smart
    Chamber**](https://www.licor.com/env/products/soil-flux/survey): for an easy
    import of data from any gas analyzer
-   [**Los Gatos Research (ABB) laser gas
    analyzers**](https://new.abb.com/products/measurement-products/analytical/laser-gas-analyzers/laser-analyzers/lgr-icos-portable-analyzers):
    Ultra-portable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (UGGA) and Microportable Greenhouse
    Gas Analyzer (MGGA) for CO~2~, CH~4~ and H~2~O
-   [**Picarro G2508 gas
    analyzer**](https://www.picarro.com/g2508_gas_concentration_analyzer): for
    CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, NH~3~ and H~2~O
-   [**GAIATECH Automated ECOFlux
    chamber**](https://www.dmr.eu/technologies/gas-emission-measurements-eco2flux/automated-eco2flux-chamber/):
    for an easy import of data from any gas analyzer

After import, the user can chose from two methods for identification of
measurements:

-   **Manual identification of measurements** - based on `start.time`, provided
    separately in an auxiliary file. The function `obs.win()` splits the
    imported data into a list of data frame (divided by `UniqueID`) and creates
    an observation window around the `start.time` to allow for a manual
    selection of the start and end points of each measurements, using the
    function `click.peak.loop()`.
-   **Automatic selection of measurements** - based on automatic recordings of
    chamber opening and closing from an instrument such as the LI-COR Smart
    Chamber or the GAIATECH Automated ECOFlux chamber.

The function `goFlux()` calculates fluxes from a variety of greenhouse gases
(CO~2~, CH~4~, N~2~O, and H~2~O) using both linear (LM) and non-linear
(Hutchinson and Mosier) flux calculation methods.

Following flux calculation, the user can select the best flux estimate (LM or
HM) based on objective criteria and non-arbitrary thresholds, using the
`best.flux()` function:

-   **Assumed non-linearity**: If all criteria are respected, the best flux
    estimate is assumed to be the non-linear estimate from the Hutchinson and
    Mosier model.
-   **G-factor**: the g-factor is the ratio between the result of a non-linear
    flux calculation model (e.g. Hutchinson and Mosier; HM) and the result of a
    linear flux calculation model ([H端ppi et al.,
    2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200876)). With the `best.flux()`
    function, one can chose a limit at which the HM model is deemed to
    overestimate (*f*~0~). [Recommended thresholds for the g-factor are \<4 for
    a flexible threshold, \<2 for a medium threshold, or \<1.25 for a more
    conservative threshold.]{.underline} The default threshold is `g.limit = 2`.
    If the g-factor is above the specified threshold, the best flux estimate
    will switch to LM instead of HM.
-   **Minimal Detectable Flux**: The minimal detectable flux (MDF) is based on
    instrument precision and measurements time ([Christiansen et al.,
    2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.06.004)). Under the MDF, the
    flux estimate is considered null, but the function will not return a 0 to
    avoid heteroscedasticity of variances. There will simply be a comment in the
    columns "LM.diagnose" or "HM.diagnose" saying that there is "No detectable
    flux (MDF)".
-   **Kappa max**: The parameter kappa determines the curvature of the
    non-linear regression in the Hutchinson and Mosier model. A large kappa,
    returns a strong curvature. A maximum threshold for this parameter,
    kappa-max, is calculated based on the minimal detectable flux (MDF), the
    linear flux estimate and the measurement time ([H端ppi et al.,
    2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200876)). The units of the
    kappa-max is s^-1^. This limit of kappa-max is included in the `goFlux()`
    function, so that the non-linear flux estimate cannot exceed this maximum
    curvature. In the function best.flux(), one can chose the linear flux
    estimate over the non-linear flux estimate based on the ratio between kappa
    and kappa-max. The ratio is expressed as a percentage, where 1 indicates
    HM.k = k.max, and 0.5 indicates HM.k = 0.5\*k.max. The default setting is
    `k.ratio = 1`.
-   **Statistically significant flux (*p-value*)**: This criteria is only
    applicable to the linear flux. Under a defined *p-value*, the linear flux
    estimate is deemed non-significant, i. e., no flux. The default threshold is
    `p.val = 0.05`.
-   **Coefficient of determination (r^~2~^)**: This criteria is used as a
    warning of a potentially "bad measurement". No best flux estimate is chosen
    based on r^2^, but a warning will be given in the column "quality.check"
    saying "Check plot (r2 \< 0.6)", for example. The default threshold is
    `r2 = 0.6`.
-   **Relative Standard Error**: The delta method is used to propagate the total
    error of the flux calculation (`deltamethod()` from the `msm` package). The
    standard error is then divided by the flux estimate to obtain the relative
    standard error (%). This criteria is used as a warning of a potentially "bad
    measurement". No best flux estimate is chosen based on SE.rel, but a warning
    will be given in the column "quality.check" saying "Check plot (SE \> 5%)",
    for example. The default threshold is `SE.rel = 5`.
-   **Intercept**: If the initial gas concentration (*C~0~*) calculated for the
    non-linear flux estimate is more or less than 20% of the linear regression's
    intercept, then a warning is issued in the "quality.check" column saying
    "Intercept out of bounds (HM)". Alternatively, one can provide boundaries
    for the intercept, for example: `intercept.lim = c(380, 420)` for a true
    *C~0~* of 400 ppm. If no limits are provided, only the non-linear
    regression's intercept can be tested. If a limit is provided, both
    intercepts are tested.

Finally, after finding the best flux estimates, one can plot the results and
visually inspect the measurements using the function `flux.plot()` and save the
plots as pdf using `flux2pdf()`.

### How to use

Here is a simple example on how to use the package with a single raw file from
LGR gas analyzers.

#### Installation

To install a package from GitHub, one must first install the package `remotes`
from the CRAN:

```{r remotes, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("remotes")
```

Then, install the `GoFluxYourself` package from GitHub:

```{r GoFluxYourself, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Qepanna/GoFluxYourself")
```

The functioning of the package depends on many other packages (`data.table`,
`dplyr`, `ggnewscale`, `ggplot2`, `graphics`, `grDevices`, `grid`, `gridExtra`,
`lubridate`, `minpack.lm`, `msm`, `pbapply`, `plyr`, `purrr`, `rjson`, `rlist`,
`SimDesign`, `stats`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `utils`), which will be installed when
installing `GoFluxYourself`. If required, it is recommended to update any
pre-installed packages.

#### Import raw data into R

```{r import, eval = FALSE}
library(GoFluxYourself)

# Get the example raw file from the package
file.path <- system.file("extdata", "LGR/example_LGR.txt", package = "GoFluxYourself")

# Import raw data from an LGR gas analyzer
?LGR_import
example_LGR_imp <- LGR_import(inputfile = file.path)
```

Note that raw data can also be imported from a multitude of other instruments,
and example data files are provided for all of them:

-   LI-COR: LI-6400, LI-7810, LI-7820, LI-8100, LI-8200 (smart chamber)
-   Los Gatos Research instruments: (e.g. UGGA and m-GGA)
-   GAIA2TECH (DMR) automated chamber ECOFlux
-   Picarro: G2508

To import multiple files from a folder, use the wrapper function
`import2Rdata()`.

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
# Get help for import functions from the GoFluxYourself package
?G2508_import
?GAIA_import
?LI6400_import
?LI7810_import
?LI7820_import
?LI8100_import
?LI8200_import
?import2Rdata
```

#### Manual identification of measurements

In this example, the `start.time` for each measurement (`UniqueID`) was noted
manually in the field, and are provided in an auxiliary file (`auxfile`).

```{r manID, eval = FALSE}
# Other usefull packages
require(dplyr)
require(purrr)

# The auxfile requires start.time and UniqueID
# start.time must be in the format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
aux.path <- system.file("extdata", "LGR/example_LGR_aux.txt", 
                        package = "GoFluxYourself")
auxfile <- read.delim(aux.path) %>% 
  mutate(start.time = as.POSIXct(start.time, tz = "UTC"))
```

When running the function `click.peak()`, for each measurement, a window will
open, in which you must click on the start point and the end point. The
observation window is based on the `start.time` given in the `auxfile`, the
length of the measurement (`obs.length`), and a `shoulder` before `start.time`
and after `start.time + obs.length`. In this example, the observation time is 3
minutes (180 seconds) and the shoulder is 30 seconds. Therefore, the observation
window shows 30 seconds before the `start.time` and 210 seconds after.

```{r obs.win, eval = FALSE}
?obs.win

# Define the measurements' window of observation
example_LGR_ow <- obs.win(inputfile = example_LGR_imp, auxfile = auxfile,
                          obs.length = 180, shoulder = 30)
```

![](man/figures/click.peak1.png)

Pay attention to the warning message given by `obs.win()` when there are more
than 20 measurements (which is not the case in this example).

Note that for more than one gas measurement, it is better to use the function
`click.peak.loop()` with `lapply()` rather than using `click.peak()` for each
measurement individually.

```{r click.peak, eval = FALSE}
?click.peak
?click.peak.loop

# Manually identify measurements by clicking on the start and end points
example_LGR_manID <- lapply(seq_along(example_LGR_ow), click.peak.loop, 
                            flux.unique = example_LGR_ow) %>%
  map_df(., ~as.data.frame(.x))
```

If the number of observation is under a certain threshold (`warn.length = 60`),
a warning will be given after clicking on the start and end points as such:

```         
Warning message: Observation length for UniqueID: 733_C_C is 59 observations
```

Otherwise, if the number of observation satisfies this threshold, then the
following message is given instead:

```         
Good window of observation for UniqueID: 733a_C_C
```

Between each measurement, the result of the `click.peak()` function is displayed
for 3 seconds. To increase this delay, change the parameter `sleep` in the
function `click.peak.loop()`.

![](man/figures/click.peak2.png)

To convert the flux estimate's units into nmol CO~2~/H~2~O m^-2^s^-1^ or 袖mol
CH~4~/N~2~O m^-2^s^-1^, the temperature inside the chamber (`Tcham`; 属C) and the
atmospheric pressure inside the chamber (`Pcham`; kPa) are also required. If
`Pcham` and `Tcham` are missing, normal atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) and
normal air temperature (15 属C) are used.

Additionally, one must provide the surface area inside the chamber (`Area`;
cm^2^) and the total volume in the system, including tubing, instruments and
chamber (`Vtot`; L). If `Vtot` is missing, one must provide an offset (distance
between the chamber and the soil surface; cm) and the volume of the chamber
(`Vcham`; L). In that case, the volume inside the tubing and the instruments is
considered negligible, or it should be added to `Vcham`.

The final output, before flux calculation requires: UniqueID, Etime, flag, Vtot
(or Vcham and offset), Area, Pcham, Tcham, H2O_ppm and other gases.

```{r add.aux, eval = FALSE}
# Additional auxiliary data required for flux calculation.
example_LGR_manID <- example_LGR_manID %>%
  left_join(auxfile %>% select(UniqueID, Area, Vtot, Tcham, Pcham))
```

#### Flux calculation

The hardest part is now behind you. All that's left is to run the flux
calculation with the `goFlux()` function. Then use the `best.flux()` function to
select the best flux estimates (LM or HM) with our list of non-arbitrary
thresholds, and plot the results for visual inspection.

```{r goFlux, eval = FALSE}
# Flux calculation -------------------------------------------------------------
?goFlux
?best.flux

# Calculate fluxes for all gas types
CO2_results <- goFlux(example_LGR_manID, "CO2dry_ppm")
CH4_results <- goFlux(example_LGR_manID, "CH4dry_ppb")
H2O_results <- goFlux(example_LGR_manID, "H2O_ppm")

# Use best.flux to select the best flux estimates (LM or HM)
# based on a list of criteria
criteria <- c("g.factor", "kappa", "MDF", "R2", "SE.rel")

CO2_flux_res <- best.flux(CO2_results, criteria)
CH4_flux_res <- best.flux(CH4_results, criteria)
H2O_flux_res <- best.flux(H2O_results, criteria)

# Plots results ----------------------------------------------------------------
?flux.plot
?flux2pdf

# Make a list of plots of all measurements, for each gastype
CO2_flux_plots <- flux.plot(CO2_flux_res, example_LGR_manID, "CO2dry_ppm")
CH4_flux_plots <- flux.plot(CH4_flux_res, example_LGR_manID, "CH4dry_ppb")
H2O_flux_plots <- flux.plot(H2O_flux_res, example_LGR_manID, "H2O_ppm")

# Combine plot lists into one list
flux_plot.ls <- c(CO2_flux_plots, CH4_flux_plots, H2O_flux_plots)

# Save plots to pdf
flux2pdf(flux_plot.ls, outfile = "demo.results.pdf")
```

Here is an example of how the plots are saved as pdf:

![](man/figures/demo.results_Page_4.png)

You can then save the results as RData or in an Excel sheet to further process
the results.

```{r save, eval = FALSE}
require(openxlsx)

# Save RData
save(CO2_flux_res, file = "CO2_flux_res.RData")
save(CH4_flux_res, file = "CH4_flux_res.RData")
save(H2O_flux_res, file = "H2O_flux_res.RData")

# Save to Excel
write.xlsx(CO2_flux_res, file = "CO2_flux_res.xlsx")
write.xlsx(CH4_flux_res, file = "CH4_flux_res.xlsx")
write.xlsx(H2O_flux_res, file = "H2O_flux_res.xlsx")
```
